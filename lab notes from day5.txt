Day5:

1)Inheritence

a)IS-A relationship
b)Has-A relationship

2)This keyword

3)Super keyword

1)Inheritence:it is a process of creating parent and child relationship between two classes so that child can access everything Parent has
->reusability


class A {
//1000 fields
//1000 methods
//
 
public voud m1(){
//some implementation
}
}

class B{
public voud m1(){
//some different implementation
}
//classB specific fields and methods

}

class C extends B extends A{
//1000 fields
//1000 methods
public voud m1(){
//some different implementation
}
//classB specific fields and methods


}


-->immediate parent and parent
-->multiple inheritence is not possible in java through classes
-->Parent reference can hold Child object and that is allowed

B b=new B();

A b=new B();

A a=new C();

B b=new A();

C c=new B();

C c=new A();


---> when  to create parent -child relationship?
when there is common functionality and required in other classess instead of duplicating we can create Parent-Child relationship


--->give least priority to IS-A unless if you want most of the functionality from parent because in future if you really want to extend any other class that 
is not feasible





This keyword: This keyword represents current instance

usecase1:when local variable and nonstatic variable are of same name we will use this keyword to resolve ambiguity
usecase2: in non static method to access another non static method THis key word is optional because JVM will add it

-->COnstructor with args:


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 6 

1)discuss rest of This key word use cases
2)Super keyword and use cases
3)Polymorphism
      -Method Overloading


This:
usecas3: constructor chaining

Note: from non static area if you are creating current class object replace with this

usecase4:method accepting current class object


Super:Super key word refers parent class reference

usecase1:if both parent and child has the same field name then child class field will have the precedence but if we want to refer to parent class field 
we should use super keyword.

usecase2:if both parent and child has the same method name then child class field will have the precedence but if we want to refer to parent class method
we should use super keyword.


from child reference how to set values  to parent class fields
usecase3:to chain superclass constructor from current class constructor

usecase4: from current class constructor call setter and assign values



----------------------------------------------------
Day 7

Polymorphism: performing one activity in multiple forms

a)Overloading : methodName+ different args
benefit:no need to define multiple methods for same functionality

if exact is match is not found compiler will not throw error immediately rather tries to typecast to highr datatypes

byte short
          int float long double
    char

class A{

public void add(){}

public void add(int b){}

public void add(byte b){}
 main(){
new A().add(5.0);
}

}

b)Overriding : IS- A relationship

class A{}

class B extends A{}

class Test{
50 methods
public A dummy(){---overridden method
//some logic
}
}

Class TestA extends Test{
 public B dummy(){---overriding  method
//some different logic
}
}


class Exception{}

class FileNotFoundxception{}

class A extends FileNotFOundxception{}

when a child class can have method same as parent then such method is called Overrding method

-->in parent -child relationship if you are not satisfied with parent class implementation we can ovverride in the child  and customize the implementation

for overriding method co-varient return types are allowed
-->overriding method return should be same as parent or childrent to overriden methods return type
--> or objects
-->exeption handling
-->public-protected-default-private
--> access modifier scope cannot be reduced
class A{
public void getA() throws A{
//some specific logic
}--->overridden method
}
}

class B extends A{
//public void getA() throws FIleNotfoundxception{
//different logic
}--->Overriding method
}

-->overloading is also called as static/early/compile polymorphism
-->overriding is also called as dynamic/lazy/ runtime polymorphism

Day 8:
1)Method Hiding
2)final class, final method and final variable
3)protected methods access
4)Abstraction
a)Abstract classes
b)interfaces




1)Method hiding:it is compiletime polymorphism

-->it will come into picture only in IS-A relationship
cte-->both parent class method and child class methods should be either static or both non static
-->method hiding is compile time polymorphism
..>in IS-A relationship if parent and child has same method and with static key word then only its method hiding


//when to define a method as static?

in you method body if your requirement  doesnt need to access non static members then only create a method as a static otherwise declare the method as non static

4)Abstraction:
the process of hiding unnecessary details and providing the necessary details is Abstraction

--> by using Abstract classes and interfaces we achieve the abstraction.

1)Abstract class

features of Abstract class:
--> we can use the keyword abstract only to classes and methods but not to the fields
--> if there is atleast one single abstract method in anyclass  that class is supposed to be delared as abstract
-->abstract methods will not have method body it will have only method declaration
-->for abstract methods will provide implementation by creating child classes
-->for abstract classes we cannot create objects
--> abstract class allows all memebrs  like anyother java class (private,public,def,protected,static and non static memebrs)

abstract class A{
private 
public void dummy();

}



2)Interfaces

-->all the methods till java 1.7 in iterfaces are abstract
--> you dont have to explicitly specify access modifier Public because every method definition in interface is by default public
--> you dont have to explicitly specify keyword Abstract because every method is by default abstract.
-->you can only have final fields because every field is by default public static final
-->implemention of abstract methods are provided by childs
--> we cant create object to interfaces

--> static methods are allowed in java from java 1.8
-->default methods are allowed in java from java 1.8


interface A implement c,d{}
class C{} 
class B extends  C implements A,n{}

abstract class Test{

non static metods , private fields
}



Day 9:

-->java.lang package

1)Object

class A extnds B{}


className@exInteger

sysout(obj.toString()); ALT+shift+s,s
a)toString
b)equals == compares the references
c)hashcode
d)finalize
e)clone
f)wait,notify and notifyall 

2)String constant pool -Strings,StringBuffer StringBuilder


-->java.lang is the only package in java which we dont have to import explicitly

-->Object class 
--> this is parent to every java class

class A{}
class B extends A{}


toString(): toString method purpose it to return string format of any object so that when you print any object jvm will invoke toString()..
we can see the data of object in meaningfull way

equals(): equals method in object class is used to compare to objects..we will have to override and provide implementation to equals() for content comparison

hashcode(): everytime we create an object JVM will create unique id for every object

-->if two objects are same by equals method there hashcode must be same


finalize():
Garbage collector is a deamon thread which will be running in back end on timely basis, it will check if there is any unrefrence objects it will clean it
--> if you want to perform any activity write in finalize method

-->if an interface contains no methods it is called marker interface
-->marker interface will give some information to JVM



cloning:it is process of taking a copy of an object

class Object{
clone()
}


class Employee{

int empId;
String empName;

Employee(int empId,Sreing empName){
this.empId=empId;
this.empName=empName;
}

main(){
Employee emp=new Employee(101,"sathish");

Employee emp1 =(EMployee)emp.clone();

}

}


shallow cloning:if a  class is not having references to any other classes then we can use object class clone method


Day 10: 

1)exception Handling
a)Try catch finally
b)exception Hierarchy
c)checked vs unchecked
d)throw
e)throws
f)custom exception
g)ovrriding with exception handling


Exceptions:are unwanted events which breaks normal execution flow

Exceptions handling:  exception handling is a mechanism through which we can provide  alternative flow of execution in the event of exception

risky code: in any piece of code if there is chance of xception that line is called risky code

we will have to provide exception handling to risky code

class A{

main(){
st0;
try{
st1;
st2;
st3

}catch(e){
st4;
st5;

}

st6;

}
}

output1: exception at st0

output2: exception at st1 and matching catch block is found 


-->finally will execute always even when an exception is occured

output3: exception at st1 and matching catch block is not found 


output4: exception at st2 and matching catch block is not found 


output5: exception at st4 


main(){

st1;
try{
st2:
}catch(){

}
st3:


}

public void div(int x){

sysout(10/x);
}

div(0);

add('c','d');


syntax:
try{
//riskicode
}catch(){

}


try{
//st1
//10/0
}fianlly{

}


checked exceptions:
compiler will check if exceptions are handled or not if not handled copiler will throw error

unchecked exceptions:compiler will not check

Fully checked exceptions:when children also fully checked

Partially checked exceptions:checked + unchecked excpetion



-->try{
//if risky code is not having chance of throwing error
}catch(fully checked exception){}



-->for fully checked exceptions we should have valid code in the try block

class Axception extends Exception{}

class BException extends Runtimexception{

}

try{
//we should some valid code
}
catch(SQLxception){
}

custom exception: exceptions developer creates as required

Checked custom exceptions: class InvalidDatexception extends IOxception 
unchecked custom exception:class  InvalidTimexception extends RuntimeException{}


-->throw keyword is used to trigger or raise an exception

-->Throws :when we should throws exception
-->if we doubt there might be chance of exception to give heads up to the caller we use throws key words
-->if we dont want th handle just to not get the compile time error we can delegate exception handling responsibility

public int div(int x) throws Arithematicxception{
return 10/x;
}







Day 11:

1) ovrriding with exception handling

class A{

public void getA() extends IOx{}
}

class B extends A{

public void getA() throws FilNF{}
}

2)Strings vs String builder vs String buffer

3)String constant pool



4)immutability

5)Wrapper classes
byte-->Byte

1)Overriding rule wrt checked exceptions


class A{
 public void getA() throws ParentCheckedxception{}
}

class B extends A{
public void getA() throws Checked{}
}


-->child can skip throws same exceptions
-->child can throw same exception or its children but not parent of overriden 



2)String

how many ways we can create String object

1) String s="sathish";
2)String s1=new String("sathish");

--> within "" everything is called as String literal


-->String is immutabilty
once a string object is created, the same object cannot be modified..if modified it will be in a new object

-->StringBuffer and String Builder are exectly same except stringbuffer methods are synchronized

--> immutability: we will not be able to change the content if tries to change create a new object


--> whenever we are modifying check if the data is existing if existing return the same otherwise create new object


Wrapper classes:

-->we call java as OOP because java developed based on OOPS principle
-->wrapper classes are to represent primitives in the form of Objects

byte-->Byte
short-->Short
int--->Integer
char-->Character
long-->Long
boolean-->Boolean
float-->Float
double-->Double

--> we cannot create objects to primitives but we can create objects to wrapper classes
-->java is not 100% oop as it is allowing primitives
--> we can always replace primitives with wrapper classes


-->every wrapper class has provided two constructors to convert primitive to wrapper

1)input as primitive 
2)String as input
ex:
byte x=30;
  new Byte(x);

3)valueOF static methods in every wrapper class is to convert primitive to Wrapper

3)String to primitive--> we can use parseXXX


--->AutoBoxing and auto unboxing ..allwed from 1.5 version

Integer x=30;
int x=new Integer(30);

Autoboxing: primitives are directly wrapped into respective wrapper ..behind the screens compile will use valueOf method

Autounboxing:wrappers can be directly assigned to primitives ..behind the screens it will be use parseXXX


Day 12: Collections Framework

1)Why collections..collections vs arrays
2)Collection hierarchy
3)list implementation classes
4)iterators
5)Set
6)Equals and hashcode


1)Why collections: ollections are used to store group of elemets as single 
entity by allowing both homogeneous and heterogeneous without any size limitation and provided utility methods

//arrays size is predefined and fixed
//arrays are homogeneous
//since arrays doesnt follow any data structures there are no utility methods for common processing


-->collections are growable in nature

List:(arraylist,linkedlist,vector and stack)
-->insertion to be preserved
-->duplicates to be allowed

Set:
-->insertion is not preserved its based on ds
-->duplocates are not allowed

shortcut to rename a field :alt +shift + R
shortcut to duplicate a line:ctrl+alt+down arrow
shortcut to delet a lint :ctrl+d




Vector 1.0:
-->its been introduced in 1.0 version
-->its exactly same as arraylist except that all the methods are synchronized

-->if frequent operation are inserting in middle of collections AL or vectors are not recomended
-->if frequent operation are removing elements from middle of collections AL or vectors are not recomended
-->if adding element at last is the requirement Arraylist or vector is recommended
Linkedlist:
-->Datastructure is double linked list
-->if frequent operations are inserting in middle or removing Linked list is recomended.


Set implementations:

Hashset:
-->duplicates are not allowed
-->insertion order is based on hashing datastructure

-->hashset,linkedhashset,hashmap,hashtable,IHM,WHM,CHM

equals & hashcode():

the only reason -->to not allow duplicates

1)if two objects are equals by equals() then there hashcode() same
2)if two objects hashcode is different  then objects are not same
3)if two objects hashcode is same , objects may be same or may not be same


--> hashset'add method calls hashcde() if hashcode is different then it will never invoke equals() ..it determines the object is unique and adds to the set
-->if hashcode is same as existing one in the set, then only it will cal equals()  to content check and determine if the object is unique or duplicate



Day13:
1)Set implementations 
2)iterators


1)Treeset:

-->Binarytree datastructure
-->purpose of treeset is for sorting
-->duplicates shouldnt be allowed
-->insertion order is not preserved

-->the object we are trying to insert into Tresset must be of type Comparable otherwise we will get ClasscastException
-->all the wrapper classes and String are comparable classes

class Employee implements Comaprable<E>{
int empId;
String empName;
}

class Test{
main(){
NEW tS<>(new mparator())
ts.add
}

}

Day 14:

-->Map implementaion classes
1)HashTable
2)HashMap
3)LinkedHashMap
4)IdentityHashMap
5)TreeMap
6)Stack


1)Maps are used to store collection of key-value pairs as a single entity

-->empid ===>employe(empid,empname)
-->Each key-value pair is called Entry
-->keys should be unique, if with the same key if your entering different value, map updates 
-->values can be duplicaed



HashMap:
-->key and values as null

Hashtable:
-->its legacy one and exactly same as Hashmap
-->all the methods are synchronized in HashTable
-->both keys and values null is not allowed

LinkedHashMap
-->insertion order of keys is preserved

IdentityHashMap identifies duplicates based on ==



Assignment1: Hashset

class Student{
//id and name
}

if id and name is same student is equals


Assignment2: Treset
1)provide sorting based on id using comparable
2)provide sorting using empName using comparator
class Student implements Comparable{

//id and name
}


Day15:

1)Tresset
2)various ways to iterate a map
3) few utility methods 



1)Treset:

if we want to sort the key-value pair collection based on keys we should use Tree map


map:

keySet()
values()
entryset()






List:
AL-->
LL
Vector
Stack-LIFO
push, pop

Set:
Hashset
LinkedHashset
Treeset

Map:
-->keys should be unique
-->values can be duplicated

Hashtable:
-->all the methods are synchronize
-->null is not allowed anywhere
Hasmmap
-->null is allowed
linkedhM
-->insertion ordr to be preserved

TreeMap
-->sort key-value pairs based on the keys we will have to use tm

Utility methods:

list to Array

array to list


Day 16 Session1:

1)Inner classes
2)various types of Inner classes
3)ANonymous Inner classes
4)Default Methods in Interfaces
5)Static methods in Interfaces
6)Functional INterfaces
7)Lambda ExpressionS
8)StreamAPI




why do we need inner classes?


class Employee {

main(){

}

class Department{
p v m1(){}


p v m2(){}

//100
}


}



class A{}

class B{}




1)Static Inner classes


class A{

int x;

static int y;

void m1(){}

static void m2(){




}

static class B{

//non static memebers and static mebers
//from static inner class we can only access outer class static meber not the instance members

}


}


//creating object to static inner class
syntax:
new Outerclass.InnerClass();



2)Member Inner class

-->in non static inner class you can access anything from the outer class
--> in non static inner class we can only have non static mebers

class A{
//static and non static fields

class B{
//you can access anything from the outer class
}

}


==>object creation for static innerclass
new outer.inner();

==>object creation for non static inner class

Step1: create outer class object
step2:with outer class reference create inner class object

OuterClass o=new OuterClass();
o.new InnerClass();



-->Anonymous inner classes:

-->creating anonymous inner class without a name
-->create child class anynomously and override parent class methods


//syntax for anonymous Ineer class

new SuperClass(){}

--> we can create anonymous inner classes to Interfaces
--> we can create for abstract classes
--> we can create for any normal class



Lambda Expressions:

-->Lambda expressions we can only write for Interfaces.
-->Interface should consist only one abstract method
-->Lambda expressions are replacement to ANonymous inner classes for interfaces


syntax for Lambda:

()->{}

Functional interfaces:

Functional interfaces are the interfaces with one Single abstract methods
--> it can contain one abstract methods and multiple default and static methods


Default methods in interfaces:

-->Default methods are introduced in Java 8 for future enhancements to not force all implementation classes to override


Static methods:
we will use static methods in interfaces to provide utility methd support
-->if there is some common functionality required for the implementation classes of the interface instead of writing the common logic in all the implementation classes
we can write just in interface static method.


interface A{

static void sendEmail(){
//logic to send EMail
}

}

class B implements A{
 
A.sendEmail();


}

class B1 implements A{

}

class B2 implements A{}




Stream API:

-->Stream api is used to process the collection


-->method references

if the purpose of lambda expression you are writing to just call another method  we can use method refrences instead of lambda

static method references:
ClassNam::methodName


Day 17:
->map()

List<Employee>

List<String> empName
->sorted()
->iterating a map
forEach((kry,val)->{
sysout(key)

sysout(value)
})
-> Optional in java 8


Day18:
->MultiThreading
-->No of ways we can create a thread
--> accessing or retrieving a Thread object


Multithreading:

It is process of creating and executing multiple threads simultaneouly to reduce the execution time.

Thread is nothing but independent flow of execution


class Test{

main(){
//1000 instruction

}


-->Creating a Thread by extending Thread class 

Steps1: extend a class from Thread
step2: override run method
step3:invoke THread start()


class A extends Thread{

public void run(){
//instructipns
}
main(){
new A().start();
}
}

purpose of start method is to register the thread object with Threadscheduler and invoke run()

-->we should never call run() in multithreading as it is just normal method call
-->we should not override start method


Thread Life cycle:
start readytoRun running Dead


second way to create a thread object is directly creating child to Runnable

class B implements Runnable{

public void run(){

Thread th=THread.currentTHread();
//instructipns
}

class Test{
main(){
B b=new B();

THread th=new THread(b);
th.start();
th.setPriority(1-10);
th.getPriority();

}

}





}

4 ways to create a THread:

1)extends Thread and override run() and invoke by start() : this is not recommended because in future we cant extend other classes
2)implements Runnable and override run() and pass runnable object to THread constructor and call start()
3)providing runnable object as anonymous inner class to the Thread constructor
4)replacing anonymous inner class with lambda expressions


Thread prioritiy: Every thread will have a priority based on priority THread scheduler may allocatate time for the thread
default priority of main thread is 5
every subthread will attain priority from parent thread
we can give priority by calling setPriority
-->min priority is 1 and max priority 10 
-->if we give out of range we will run into IllegalArgumentException


Day 19:Project core java

Day 20: 

-->sleep()
-->yield()
-->join
-->synchronized methods



class A{

public void getA(){

}

main(){

Thread t1;

Thread t2;

t1.start();

t2.start();

//some logic

t1.join(1000);

}

}





-->sleep(): this is used to make currentThread to wait for certain amount of time
-->this might leads to an Interruptedxception so this method is designed to throw checked Exception


yield(); this is just a request to thread scheduler that to make current thread to wait and give priority to other threads, thread scheduler may consider the request
or ignore


join():  it is used to wait until other thread completes the execution.
-->used to give priority to certain thread
note: you should invoke join method on a THread object 

Synchronization: its process of making only one thread to execute a method at a time

class THreadTest{

main(){

Test t=new Test();
Thread t1=new THread(()->{
t.getA();
})

Thread t2=new THread(()->{
t.getB();
})

t1.join();



}

}
class Test{

public synchronized void getA(){


}


public synchronized void getB(){}

public void getC(){}


}


--> when we have multiple synchronized() in a class

if one thread gets a chance to execute one synchronized method ..
in the mean time no other thread can execute any synchronized method but always can execute non synchronized methods

day 21:
1)Static synchronized
2)synchronized blocks
3)inter thread communication
4)Deamon THreads


class A{
main(){

Test t=new Test();

Test t0=new Test();
Thread t1=new THread(()->{t.getTest());
Thread t2=new THread(()->{t0.getTest());
t1.start();
t2.start();
}
}

class Test{

public void static synchronized getTest(){}

}




static synchronized: There are two kinds of locks

1)Object level--> just synchronized
2)class level -->using static synchronized


->when you define a method as synchronized it is object level locking , if multiple threads try to access synchronized method on same object then we will achieve data
consistency because the other threads will be in waiting state

-->, if multiple threads try to access synchronized method with different objects we will not achieve data consistency because its object level locking and each thread is 
using different lock

-->when to go for class level locking?

when you have multiple threads and multiple objects and if you want achieve data consistency use class level locking(static synchronized)


Synchronized block:


public  void printNumbersSecond50() {
//1000 instruction

synchronized(this){
//1 instruction requires consistency
}		
}


synchronized(Test.class){
//1 instruction requires consistency
}		



Inter Thread Communication:

-->One thread can communicate with other thread by using wait,notify and notifyALl
-->inter thread communication comes into picture only with synchronized block or a method that is with object level locking.

-->inter thread communication has come into picture to solve Consumer Producer problem

-->there is thread it produces something
-->there is another thread it consumers consumming

public void getA(){

synchronized(A.class){
wait();

}


} 



-->wait,notify , notifyall are present in object class
-->wait,notify , notifyall are final methods we cant override
-->wait(),notify() and notifyAll() can be called only from synchronized context


wait:

-->in synchronized block thread should the acquire lock and continue execution but as soon as you call wait() it releases the lock and will be waiting untill other thread
notifies it



day 22:
1)inter thread communication example
2)Deamon Threads
3)FIle IO
4)Generics
5)Serialisation
6)doubt clearing session on total core java

2)DeamonTHreads:

Deamon threads are service threads to main threads, once main thread dead service thread also dies automatically

-->how to make a THread as deamon-->by calling setDeamon()
-->to check if a thread is deamon-->isDeamon();
-->deamon threads are low priority threads

3)FIleIO: sometimes we will have to read data from the file and write the data to a file

BufferedWriter:FileWriter
BufferedReader:FileReader


4)Generics: the main objective of generics in java is to resolve Typecasting and providing typesafety
-->Generics is intoduced in 1.5 v

ex:
ArrayList<String> al=new ArrayList<>();
here String is called generic parameter type


challenge1:without generics is Typecasting 
challenge2:classcastingException if not type casting



checked exception and unchecked exception:

uncheckedexceptions: we can create custom unchecked exception by extenidng RuntimeException or it children
checkedxception: by extending Exception or on any of its children but not Runtimexception



Serialisation:

IT is process of converting state of of the java object to the network supported format is called serialisation


class Em{
int id;
String dept;
String collegre;
}


new Employe(101,"eee",'vit')
-->it should implement Serializable
-->FIleOutputStream and and ObjectOutputStream

Deserialisation: it is process of converting network supported format to java object

-->FIleInputStream and ObjectInputStream


Transient: when you define a field as transient it will not participate in serialisation



day 23: 

SQL concepts

->Applications will store data in databases in structured way so that we can do CRUD operations easily.

C-CREATE 
R-read or retrieve
U-update
D-DELETE

mysql: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

installation video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuBcTJnIuzo


common queries:

step1 : create a database

query1:show databases; --> it will show all the available databases in the system

query2:create database testing;
ex:create database testing;

query3: logging into database
use testing;

CREATE TABLES:

syntax: create table tablename(columnname datatype, columnname datatype)

ex:create table Employee(empId int,empName varchar(255), dept varchar(255));

class Employee{

int empId;

String empName;

String dept;



}


-creating a record

inserting data into table:

insert into tablename(columname,coulumname) values(value1,value2);

ex: insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept) values(101,'sathish','dept');

insert into Employee values(109,'rakhi','ece',34);

R-Read or retrieve a record from database
select queries:

to see all columns:

select * from tablename

to read specific columns 
syntax: select columname1,columnname2 from tablename


where clause: it is uesd to specify a condition

select * from tablename
where 

to check if column is null:
select * from  Employee
where dept is null;

>

<

=

in

between: specify range


order by-it is used for sorting based on columns

-->to specify two conditions we can use and or &&

-->to specify two conditions we can use or or ||



dropping a table:

drop table tablename;









update:

update tablename 
set columname=value;

ex: select * from  Employee


show databases;

create database testing;

USE testing;

show tables;

show databases;

use mysql;

create table Employee(empId int,empName varchar(255), dept varchar(255),age INT);

insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(103,'sathish','eee',45);
insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(104,'tom','cse',24);
insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(105,'kumar','eee',45);

insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(106,'raj','eee',45);
insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(107,'sam','it',15);

CRUD

Alter commands:

adding column to existing table

alter table tablename
add columnaname datatype

ex:

alter table Employee
add city varchar(50);


removing a column to existing table

alter table Employee

primary key: unique and not null : the purpose of primary key is to represent a row as unique

foreign key:

unique:it should not be repeated

not null: we should pass some value while inserting the data

queries:

show databases;

create database testing;

USE testing;

show tables;

show databases;

use mysql;

drop table EMployee;
create table Employee(empId int   primary key,empName varchar(255), dept varchar(255),age INT not null);

insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept) values(103,'sathish','eee');
insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(101,'tom','cse',24);
insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(105,'kumar','eee',45);

insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(106,'raj','eee',45);
insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(107,'sam','it',15);
insert into Employee(empId,empName,dept,age) values(108,'praveen','cse',16);

insert into Employee(age,empId,empName,dept) values(27,111,'sau','it');

select * from  Employee
where age>20 && age <40;

select * from  Employee
where dept ='cse' || dept='it';

select * from Employee
where dept in ('cse','it','ece');

select * from employee
where empId between 105 and 108;

select * from Employee
order by empName  ;

delete from EMployee
where empId=107;

day 24:
1)Aggregate functions (count,sum,max,min,average)
2)GroupBy
3)joins
->inner join
->left join
->right join
->full outer join not available in sql)

->count agrregator is used to find no of records

1)select count(*) from  Employee
2)select count(pk field) from EMployee

->sum aggregator is used to sum data on some column

select sum(age) from  Employee


->Max
to find max record on some coumn

select empName,max(age) from  Employee

->to find the least value on some column

-->avg

select avg(age) from EMployee


GroupBy: it is used group date based on unique columns
->it is used along with aggregators

->get me count of employees from each department?
eee-3
ece-6
it-5

->how many people of same age
24-3
25-1
26-9

-->from each department get me the eldest person

-->Foreign key : it is used to establish relationship between two table


create table skills_employee(skillId int primary key, skillName varchar(255), empIdfk int, foreign key (empIdfk) references Employee(empId) )

 rules:
-> in order to insert into foreign key table, first we will have to insert data into primary key table
->from pk table we cannot delete directly, first we will have to delete fk table row then pk table row



day 25:

1)Having
2)cartesian product
3)joins
a)left outer join
b)right join
c)full joins
d)inner joins

4) unit testing on high level



Having: it will come into picture only when we use group by clause
->we can use aggregators in having
-> we should use same aggregator which we use in select clause

cartisan product:
combining two tables into one single table with columns from both the tables is cartisan product
->applying conditions on resultant cartisan product is nothing but join
